# Lies of P Enemy Randomizer - Alpha Build

Welcome to the early alpha build of the **Lies of P Enemy Randomizer**! Your feedback during this phase is invaluable in shaping the final release.

## How to Use:

### 1. Randomize:
- Click the "Randomize" button.
- **Note**: Asynchronous processing is disabled in this build, so the program may temporarily hang during randomization. This is normal behavior.

### 2. Wait:
- The process is complete when the "Randomize" button turns yellow again.

### 3. Locate Randomized Files:
- Your randomized files will be saved in:  
  `C:\loprandoalpha`

### 4. Move Files to Mods Folder:
- Copy the randomized files to your `~mods` folder.  
  If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, create it at the following path:  
D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Lies of P\LiesofP\Content\Paks~mods

### 5. Launch and Enjoy:
- Start the game, and your randomized content will be applied.

## Additional Notes:

### Crashes or Empty Boss Rooms:
- If the game crashes or a boss room is empty:
1. Restart the game.
2. If the issue persists, re-run the randomizer and try again.
3. Report these issues with details about the boss that caused the error.

### Compatibility Requirements:
- The randomizer is developed using **.NET Framework 8.0**.
- Ensure you have the latest version of the .NET Framework installed if the randomizer does not launch.

## Key Features:

### Important NPCs:
- Critical NPCs are protected and will not be replaced to ensure that key items are dropped as intended.
- Butterflies are also protected.
- All NPCs are assigned the same faction to prevent NPC-vs-NPC scenarios. This is hardcoded as `TRUE` in the alpha but will be a toggleable option in the beta.

### NPC Scaling:
- In the alpha, NPCs (excluding bosses) spawn as scaled versions.  
This will be a toggleable option in the beta.

## Beta Preview:
- The beta build will re-enable all options, allowing for a fully customizable experience.

## Feedback:
- This alpha focuses on identifying bugs and improving functionality.
- Please report issues or suggestions to help refine the randomizer.
