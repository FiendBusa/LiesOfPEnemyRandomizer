Lies of P Enemy Randomizer - Alpha Build
Welcome to the early alpha build of the Lies of P Enemy Randomizer! Your feedback during this phase is invaluable in shaping the final release.

How to Use:
Randomize:

Click the "Randomize" button.
Note: Asynchronous processing is disabled in this build, so the program may temporarily hang during randomization. This is normal behavior.
Wait:

The process is complete when the "Randomize" button turns yellow again.
Locate Randomized Files:

Your randomized files will be saved in:
C:\loprandoalpha
Move Files to Mods Folder:

Copy the randomized files to your ~mods folder.
If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, create it at the following path:
makefile
Copy code
D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Lies of P\LiesofP\Content\Paks\~mods
Launch and Enjoy:

Start the game, and your randomized content will be applied.
Additional Notes:
Crashes or Empty Boss Rooms:
If the game crashes or a boss room is empty:
Restart the game.
If the issue persists, re-run the randomizer and try again.
Report these issues with details about the boss that caused the error.
Compatibility Requirements:
The randomizer is developed using .NET Framework 8.0.
Ensure you have the latest version of the .NET Framework installed if the randomizer does not launch.
Key Features:
Important NPCs:
Critical NPCs are protected and will not be replaced to ensure that key items are dropped as intended.
Butterflies are also protected.
All NPCs are assigned the same faction to prevent NPC-vs-NPC scenarios.
This is hardcoded as TRUE in the alpha but will be a toggleable option in the beta.
NPC Scaling:
In the alpha, NPCs (excluding bosses) spawn as scaled versions.
This will be a toggleable option in the beta.
Beta Preview:
The beta build will re-enable all options, allowing for a fully customizable experience.
Feedback:
This alpha focuses on identifying bugs and improving functionality.
Please report issues or suggestions to help refine the randomizer.
